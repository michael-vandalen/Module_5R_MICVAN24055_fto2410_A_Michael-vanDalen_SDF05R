# [SDF05] CSS Magic Buttons

## Project Description

I was tasked to style 3 buttons using CSS where I inserted different animations and styled it with colors that catches the eye.

## Design Choices

I styled button 1 with a rainbow animation and made it transition when hovering over the button using the hover pseudo class.

Button 2 was styled with the goal that the button gets bigger as you hover over it and back to normal when you move your cursor away.

Button 3 was almost a mix of the two where it gets bigger when you hover over it but has a glowing color while doing so. When you click with your mouse the background of the button turns white.

## Notes

I am particularly proud of button 3 because I feel it can be used in a website somewhere but maybe just with a different color.
